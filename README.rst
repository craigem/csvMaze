CSV Maze
========

This code is based upon [Maze generation
(Haskell)](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Maze_generation#Haskell) by [Rosetta
Code](http://rosettacode.org/) which in turn is based upon [Maze generation
algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/).

The goal of this application is to generate CSV files of random mazes so that
they may be used to create mazes in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/) as
per **Building a Maze** in **Adventure 6** of [Adventures in
Minecraft](http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111894691X.html).
